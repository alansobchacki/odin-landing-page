Project #2: Landing Page
=============

A static landing page using Flexbox and a designer prompt.

Here's the [live project demo.](https://alansobchacki.github.io/odin-landing-page/)

Disclaimer
-----

This is my second project, following the [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) web development curriculum. 

It is intentionally left as-is to document my learning journey and to contribute to the open-source community so that other students can learn from the same project stages.

Also, as directed by The Odin Project's guidelines:

> When making interactive projects, like this one, you might be tempted to add more features, improve interactivity, user experience, design and styling of your website, and so on.
> 
> We recommend not doing that, and saving this effort for your portfolio projects. Focus mainly on the requirements of the project.


About
-----

This project was completed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) [Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) curriculum. It is the second project required for completion of the Foundations Course.

These were the project requirements:

- [x] Download the design images to see what your website should look like.
- [x] Use Flexbox to align everything properly.


What I Learned
-----

In this project, I solidified my understanding of CSS, particularly the box model and Flexbox. 

I learned how padding, margins, and borders affect layout, and how to inspect and debug styles using browser tools.

Notes
-----

This looks much better than my first project, that's for sure. Flexbox is such a game changer!
